## Practical Project Martin Bende

### About the project
Welcome to my project where I explore the integration of PHP and GO, two popular programming languages, 
in various ways to determine their performance and scalability. In today's technology-driven world, 
it is crucial for developers to be able to combine multiple languages and technologies to create efficient and scalable solutions. 
With this project, I aim to demonstrate how the integration of PHP and GO can enhance the performance of web applications and provide a high level of scalability.

By the end of this project, I hope to provide insights into the best practices for connecting PHP and GO, and offer a clear understanding of the benefits and drawbacks of each approach. 
This project will be useful for developers who are looking to build high-performance web applications that can handle a large amount of traffic 
and are interested in exploring different ways to combine PHP and GO.
